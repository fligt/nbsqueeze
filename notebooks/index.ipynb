    "Creating plots in Jupyter notebooks is great for exploring your data. The images that are generated by your plotting code are conveniently stored within the notebook file as base64 encoded text strings. A downside to this approach is that Jupyter notebooks with many plots easily become quite large. Uploading such large notebook files to github  and subsequent testing and rendering of such notebooks to produce documentation soon becomes intolerably slow... \n",
